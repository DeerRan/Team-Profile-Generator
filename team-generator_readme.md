## Description  
This application is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Installation
Simply grab it off the Github, run "npm install" in the terminal, and run "node index.js".
## Usage
A series of prompts will ask basic questions about an employee, from there you can either add more employees or finish generating the HTML.
## Contribution
Not accepting any contribution! This was a homework assignment and I don't have plans on revisiting this for revisions.
## Testing
The test files within this project test for the basic functionality of the class' constructors and functions.
